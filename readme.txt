Juggling simulator! 1 GREEN pixels will bounce around the screen and your job is to make sure that the pixel does not hit the bottom of the screen by using the blue paddle. 
Your directional controls are the left and right arrows on the keyboard. If the GREEN pixel hits the bottom of the screen, it will turn RED meaning you lose.
